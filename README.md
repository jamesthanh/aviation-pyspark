# Aviation Simulation
Spark from Python! Spark is a tool for doing parallel computation with large datasets and it integrates well with Python. 
PySpark is the Python package that makes the magic happen. You'll use this package to work with data about flights from Portland and Seattle. 
I performed data wrangling and built a whole machine learning pipeline to predict whether or not flights will be delayed. 

# Project Technicalities
- Use SparkSQL and Temp Table
- EDA with SQL Statements - Selecing, Grouping, Filtering, Aggerating and Joining State
- Use pyspark.ml Pipeline
- Implement tuning submodule
- Build LogisticRegression Estimator
- Apply CrossValidator
- Achive overal 70% of accuracy on a real world situation where most of flight delays are challenging to predict. 

# Usages
- Need to install spark and apache spark
- Code are located in main.ipynb
